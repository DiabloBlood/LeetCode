## Full Binary Tree vs. Complete Binary Tree
> https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs163/Doc/FullvsComplete.html
- A **full binary tree** (sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree) is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
- A **complete binary tree** is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

## Tree Depth vs. Tree Height
> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2603692/what-is-the-difference-between-tree-depth-and-height
- The **depth** of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node. A root node will have a depth of 0.
- The **height** of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf. A leaf node will have a height of 0.
- The **height** of a tree would be the height of its root node, or equivalently, the depth of its deepest node.
